**Collapse** was firstly made specifically for **Honkai Impact 3rd**. But since the progress of this project, this launcher is now an advanced launcher for **miHoYo Games**.

# Why called Collapse?
Collapse was came from **Honkai Impact** name in Chinese and Japanese. The word came from [**Â¥©Âùè**] or **Bƒìng hu√†i** in Chinese and also [**Â¥©Â£ä**] or **Houkai** in Japanese. Both means "**Collapse**" and that's why we are choosing this as our launcher name and since this launcher was supposed to be an alternative launcher for Honkai Impact 3rd in the first place.

**Collapse** has some advanced features for **Honkai Impact 3rd** that not only provides you a feature to download and launch the game, but also some advanced features that the Official Launcher doesn't have, including:
* Caches Download (or aka. "Updating Settings" in-game).
* Game Data Repair (with less data needed than Data Repair feature in-game).
* Changing Game Settings (like: Graphics Settings and Audio Settings) without opening the game.
* Multi-Region Game Download (Supporting: Southeast Asia, Global, TW/HK/MO, Mainland China and Korea version).
* Steam to Global version conversion (without re-downloading the whole game).
* Global to SEA version (or vice versa) conversion.
* Multi-session Download for Game Download/Installation.
* Multi-thread Game Extraction for faster installation.
* Delta-Patch Update Mechanism for smaller update ([**Click here**](https://github.com/neon-nyan/CollapseLauncher/wiki/Update-Game-Region-with-Delta-Patch) for more info).
* Ability to select Graphics API (DirectX 11 (FL: 10.1, 11.0 and 11.1) and DirectX 12 [May crash the game in newer stages]).

Not only that, this launcher has also some advanced features for **Genshin Impact** like:
* Choosing your voice-line language at first-install so you don't have to download it inside the game.
* ~~Repair the game files entirely including game caches, cutscenes, audio pack and persistent files.~~ Temporarily disabled due to changes on Genshin's Dispatcher structure.

# Supported Game Client
For now, this launcher is only supporting these versions of the game:
* Southeast Asia
* Global
* TW/HK/MO
* Mainland China
* Korea

# Other Supported Game Client
This launcher also supports other game client, including:
* Genshin Impact (Global Release)
* ÂéüÁ•û / Yuan Shen (Mainland China's Genshin)
* ~~Honkai: Star Rail~~ (Waiting for Official Release)

Some features like Game Data Repair and Preload Download are available for this game but other things like Game Settings and Caches Download aren't available for this Game Client.
